(recording available soon)

Interpretation methods :
Saliency or removal of fluff until we know what caused the prediction
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-19-59.png)

Look for global decision rules :

Full list :

- First two in ACL 2020 tutorial
- No comprehensive resource for baking interpretability into model

This tutorial focuses on :

- Looking at input features, global decision rules and looking at training data

## Why did my model make this prediction?

- Saliency maps :
  - Using gradients
  - Using perturbations

- Perturbations as explanations
  - Input reduction
  - Adversarial perturbations

### Saliency maps

Relative importance of each token in the input w.r.t prediction
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-29-58.png)

![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-33-25.png)

How to do it?
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-37-04.png)

#### Using gradients

Problems with gradient for saliency maps :

- Very noisy locally
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-38-58.png)
- Saturated outputs lead to unintuitive gradients
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-40-42.png)
- Discontinuous gradients (thresholding) problematic

How to mitigate the issues? => Don't rely on single gradient calculation

- SmoothGrad
- Integrated Gradients

SmoothGrad :
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-48-33.png)

Integrate the gradients over a path from zero to input : Integrated gradients
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-45-48.png)

- Have to have access to gradients
- Not customizable

#### Using perturbations

- Works with black-box models
- Allows input perturbations to be defined

Methods :

- Leave one out : Remove token/phrase and look at drop in confidence
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-53-43.png)
  Problem : Only removing **one** token
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-56-12.png)

- LIME :
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-57-27.png)
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-16-59-37.png)

Problems :
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-02-53.png)

Linear representations can be limited : double negations
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-05-25.png)

### Perturbations as explanations

- Input reduction
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-21-57.png)
  Remove words that keep prediction the same

Examples
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-23-28.png)

Problems :
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-30-49.png)

- Adversarial examples in NLP
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-31-52.png)

Are they as good as explanations?
It can detect which is the word(s) responsible for a prediction
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-35-26.png)

Problems:
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-37-03.png)

## What decision rule led to a prediction?

Previously talked about local explanations, what about global explanations?

See patterns in data, decision rules

- Anchors :
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-45-21.png)
  Anchor is a simple decision rule

![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-47-41.png)

Computing anchors :
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-50-19.png)

- Universal adversarial triggers :
  Whenever this text is present, triggers a prediction
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-52-59.png)

Start with "the the the", backprop gradient of loss, dot product with embedding matrix and take words with highest score
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-55-03.png)

Example :
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-17-56-50.png)
Problems in datasets : nobody was associated a lot with contradiction

Pros / cons of interpretation via decision rules :

- Can identify global bugs in models / datasets
- Hard to find broad coverage rules : very specific or non-actionable

Q : how to constrain search to plausible triggers?
A : Can use LM to rate plausibility of triggers

## Which training example is responsible for a prediction?

Detect wrongly labeled data for example :
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-18-35-05.png)

![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-18-35-57.png)

Benefits of interpretation via training data :

- We know where did we pick up patterns
- Actionable : incorrect labels, biases, annotation artifacts

More precise : Which examples, if removed, would change the loss a lot?

- What would be the prediction of test set data point x given that we remove z from training set?
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-18-41-02.png)
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-18-41-58.png)

Use "influence functions" :

- Principled approach for estimating influence
- Works empirically for many models
  Problems :
- Scales poorly with size of model and training data
- Theory only applies to convex setting, can struggle for neural models

Alternative method : representor point selection
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-18-45-43.png)

Hasn't been used much in NLP but interesting research direction
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-18-48-39.png)

Problems with data influence :

- Influential points can be uninterpretable
- Computationally expensive
- Often requires approximations that may be invalid
- How does it interact with pretrained models?

## How to implement this?

Different access requirements :
![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-19-05-35.png)

- Black box : not much to say
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-19-06-25.png)

- Need gradients, vanilla gradient implementation :
  Purple (need to implement yourself)
  ![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-19-09-00.png)

![](emnlp2020-notes/assets/images/2020-11-19-19-10-26.png)

Use hooks :
