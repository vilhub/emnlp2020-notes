Abstract: True-casing, the task of restoring proper case to (generally) lower case input, is important in downstream tasks and for screen display. In this paper, we investigate truecasing as an in- trinsic task and present several experiments on noisy user queries to a voice-controlled dia- log system. In particular, we compare a rule- based, an n-gram language model (LM) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) approaches, evaluating the results on a German Q&A cor- pus and reporting accuracy for different case categories. We show that while RNNs reach higher accuracy especially on large datasets, character n-gram models with interpolation are still competitive, in particular on mixed- case words where their fall-back mechanisms come into play.
