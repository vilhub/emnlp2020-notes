## Improving Out-of-Scope Detection in Intent Classification by Using Embeddings of the Word Graph Space of the Classes

Paulo Cavalin, Victor Henrique Alves Ribeiro, Ana Appel, Claudio Pinhanez 

Abstract : This paper explores how intent classification can be improved by representing the class labels not as a discrete set of symbols but as a space where the word graphs associated to each class are mapped using typical graph embedding techniques. The approach, inspired by a previous algorithm used for an inverse dictionary task, allows the classification algorithm to take in account inter-class similarities provided by the repeated occurrence of some words in the training examples of the different classes. The classification is carried out by mapping text embeddings to the word graph embeddings of the classes. Focusing solely on improving the representation of the class label set, we show in experiments conducted in both private and public intent classification datasets, that better detection of out-of-scope examples (OOS) is achieved and, as a consequence, that the overall accuracy of intent classification is also improved. In particular, using the recently-released \\emph{Larson dataset}, an error of about 9.9% has been achieved for OOS detection, beating the previous state-of-the-art result by more than 31 percentage points.

- Users can challenge the chatbot with out of scope questions
- Users do not know capabilities

Classic OOS detection methods :

- Rejection thresholding
- Specific classes (OTHER)
- Binary or one-class classification

Idea : build a word graph : words connected to classes
Takes into account inter-class similarities
Map text embeddings to word graph embeddings of classes
Better OOS achieved
