# Machine translation and multilinguality

## BLEU might be Guilty but References are not Innocent

BLEU score :

- BLEU not good metric for high scores
- MT models higher BLEU than human translations !
- High cross-BLEU between predictions of good MT models, similar MT models
- What does BLEU measure other than translation quality?

Reference translations :

- Biased translation by humans : tend to translate word for word (translationese)
- Several different translations : Maximizing BLEU => produce very average monotonic translation

Idea : ask humans for paraphrases of target sentences

- Humans rate MT models trained with paraphrases much better
- BLEU correlates a lot better with quality when using paraphrases

## Simulated multiple reference training improves low-resource machine translation

- Lots of different ways of translating sentence

- Think of translations as paraphrases of target sentence

- Idea : Introduce paraphraser, sample from distribution and generate different paraphrases

- Similar to word-level knowledge distillation

- Train using synthetic paraphrase dataset

- Result : 1.2 to 7 BLEU improvements

- Complementary to back-translation

## Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation in Many Languages via Zero-Shot Paraphrasing

- Idea : seq2seq paraphraser to score translations
- BLEU correlation with quality breaks down for high BLEU scores
- Retain meaning of input, fluent but lexically / syntactically unbiased
- Multilingual NMT as zero-shot paraphraser
  e.g. translate English to intermediate language-agnostic representation, translate back to English
- Much better correlation with quality than BLEU

## Unsupervised Quality Estimation for Neural Machine Translation

Marina Fomicheva, Shuo Sun, Lisa Yankovskaya, Frédéric Blain, Francisco Guzmán, Mark Fishel, Nikolaos Aletras, Vishrav Chaudhary, Lucia Specia 

- Goal similar to paper above
- No paraphraser, uncertainty quantification approach
